Wildrun is a group project completed in just over 6 weeks.
The group was composed of 4 Artists and 6 Progs.
This game was featured at the PGW 2019 on the Made in France stand.

In this project I developed the customization of the vehicles, the management of the race (laps, ranks, victory, 
instantiation of vehicles ...) and I also touched on lobby and input management.
